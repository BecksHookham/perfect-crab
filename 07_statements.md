## Statements
[Vimeo](https://vimeo.com/954334376/0c486313d0#t=0)

```python
added = 2 + 3
````

* That statement uses the `=` operator to assign the result of the expression on
the right (`2 + 3`) to the name on the left (`added`).

* It's called a statement because it changes the 'state' of the program.

**added** is the variable. This is because the name stay the same, but the values assigned can vary.
