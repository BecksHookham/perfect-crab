```python
def just_return_it(num):

A function is a reusable block of code.

It takes an input, processes it in some way, and then returns an output.

This 'just_return_it' function has:

**A name:**

'just_return_it' that we can use to call it.

**A parameter:**

'num' that is the input. You might also hear these informally referred to as 'arguments'

**Call a function like this**

```python
just_return_it(4)
````

This returns 4

**See an example: print**

```python
print("just_return_it(4) returns:")
print(just_return_it(4))
````

**Troubleshooting**
Video: [I lost the terminal](https://vimeo.com/1061335416/4f5eb4a48f)

- Spaces tell you what the body of the function is. The code won't work if you don't use spaces. 
- Some people use terminal and shell interchangeably but the terminal is the app/window you open and the shell is the program running inside terminal that interprets your commands (zsh, bash, etc).
