**Creating Your CodeSpace**
- Green Button on the Right > Use this template > Open in a codespace

_Github is now creating my own copy of the material in a codespace. I can see the files and edit, write and run the code._

**Why are we using GitHub Codespaces?**
 
Middle ground between beginner interface and professional coding environment. More realistic than other systems.

**IDE**

Browser-based integrated environment called VS Code.

We don't need to install anything. IDE is ready to go.

**Terminal**

- Where we run the code.
- Stay in the terminal. Don't go off into other tabs yet (ports etc.)

**Editor**

- Where we run the code

**Reconfigure Page**

- Resize terminal
- Click next to port to access context menu.

**Run a Test Python Program**

python lib/trial.py

**Editor**
