## [Operators](https://vimeo.com/954334235/902b0b036d#t=606)

**What is a logical operator**

Logical operators work on **boolean values** and let you combine them to make true / false statements.

I think we are actually working on **arithmetic operators** here.

A **boolean value** is the simplest kind of data in programming: it can only be `True` or `False`.
It's named after George Boole, the mathematician who created Boolean logic.
The data type is a `bool`


| Code           | What is it?                                        |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| def            | `def` is a keyword that defines a new function     |
| add_one        | `add_one` is the function name                     |
| (num)          | `(num)` is the parameter list                      |
| num            | `num` is a parameter                               |
| :              | The `:` symbol indicates the body should start now |
| return num + 1 | `return num + 1` is a statement                    |
| num + 1        | `num + 1` is an expression                         |
| num            | `num` here is a variable                           |
| +              | `+` is an operator                                 |
| 1              | `1` is a literal number                            |


```python
````
**Addition**

```python
added = 2 + 3
print(f"2 + 3 = {added} (should be 5)")
````
**Multiplication**

```python
multiplied = 2 * 3
print(f"2 * 3 = {multiplied} (should be 6)")
````

**Subtraction**

```python

subtracted = 2 - 3
print(f"2 - 3 = {subtracted} (should be -1)")

````
**Division**

```python

divided = 2 / 3
print(f"2 / 3 = {divided} (should be 0.6666666666666666)")

````
_This kind of 'decimal point' number, 0.6666666666666666 is called a float, by the way, meaning 'floating point'_
